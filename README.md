# SlideModalPicker 


A nice little wrapper for pickers. On iOS, they slide up from the bottom, and on Android the dialogs appear like normal. Only needs one implementation. Should save you some trouble.

On Android these only work for date/time/datetime pickers right now, and not the regular ol' pickers. I might try to figure that out later, but seeing as how it's super easy to just implement the regular picker on Android––much easier to implement it into this package, anyways––so don't count on it.

I'm not going to spend much (read: any) time on this––I made it for personal use and (based on a few Google searches) decided publishing it would fill a hole––so it might be safer for you to just go into the source code and copy and paste it into your project rather than installing the npm package. With that said, here's how to use it.
