# SlideModalPicker 


A nice little wrapper for iOS pickers so they slide up from the bottom of the screen. Made this for personal use, not to make a killer package.

Not cross platform b/c that would have been too much trouble––iOS and Android pickers are pretty different. Imo I'm better off implementing them separately.

That might change though. After making the Android version I'll see how easy/difficult it would be to put em together.
